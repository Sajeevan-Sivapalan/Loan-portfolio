      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-center">
    Despite the rise of digital education platforms in Sri Lanka, A/L Biology students still face significant challenges due to the lack of personalized and adaptive learning tools. Existing platforms are often static, offering limited support for vocabulary retention, comprehension of large volumes of text, or development of exam-oriented answering skills. They do not adapt to a student's individual performance or provide detailed feedback, making it difficult for learners to identify and improve on weak areas. Moreover, there is minimal integration of features that support auditory learners, topic-specific summaries, or structured answer evaluation-all of which are crucial for mastering A/L Biology. This gap calls for a more holistic solution that aligns with the local syllabus, accommodates diverse learning styles, and provides real-time, actionable insights to guide student progress-goals that BioMentor aims to fulfill.
